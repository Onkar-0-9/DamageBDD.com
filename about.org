* About DamageBDD

Welcome to DamageBDD! We are a cutting-edge technology company founded
by Steven, an experienced developer and a passionate
solopreneur. Steven's expertise lies in using Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD) to ensure the performance and quality of server-side
applications.

At the beginning of his journey, Steven started using Behave BDD to
verify the behavior of his applications. However, he soon encountered
limitations and complexities in managing the entire infrastructure
required to support a BDD workflow. This led him on a quest to find a
better solution in the market. However, most available options were
subscription-based or required additional software installations to
manage tests or was just clunky.

Steven envisioned a tool that would integrate seamlessly with CI/CD
workflow, making it exceptionally user-friendly for him and his
team. This is when DamageBDD was born. With DamageBDD, managing your
tests is as simple as running a curl command. No special software
installations required.

After successfully completing his own startup journey, Steven was
determined to productize DamageBDD and share the efficiency gains he
experienced with the wider industry. He firmly believes that DamageBDD
can effectively maintain high-quality, highly available software. Its
simplicity and versatility make it applicable to a wide range of use
cases.

Join us on this exciting journey as we revolutionize the way software
is developed and maintained. With DamageBDD, you can ensure the
highest standards of performance, quality, and availability for your
applications. Experience the power of BDD without the complexity
it's just a command away!

Welcome to DamageBDD - where simplicity meets power!

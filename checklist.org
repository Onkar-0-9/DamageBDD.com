* 🧑💻 Task Submission Checklist - Code Like a Pro 🚀

Welcome, coder! Before you submit your latest masterpiece, let’s run through a quick checklist to ensure everything’s polished, efficient, and ready for prime time. Follow these steps to keep things smooth and professional.

---

**1. Branching & Commits 🔧**
- [ ] Created a new branch for the task (e.g., `feature/xyz` or `bugfix/xyz`)?
- [ ] Commit messages are clear, concise, and describe the changes you’ve made?
- [ ] Commits are atomic—one logical change per commit, no clutter!

---

**2. Code Quality ✨**
- [ ] Code is clean, readable, and follows the project’s coding standards.
- [ ] Functions and methods are small, focused, and reusable.
- [ ] Avoided unnecessary complexity—keep it simple, keep it elegant.

---

**3. Testing 🧪**
- [ ] New features are covered by tests (unit, integration, etc.)?
- [ ] All existing tests pass—no broken builds on your watch!
- [ ] Ran tests locally or via CI to ensure everything’s working as expected.

---

**4. Pull Request (PR) 🚨**
- [ ] PR title is clear and reflects the changes made (e.g., `Fix button alignment on mobile`)
- [ ] PR description includes a summary of the changes and any context for reviewers.
- [ ] Rebased your branch with the latest `main` branch? A clean commit history is always preferred.
- [ ] PR is reviewed and approved by at least one teammate.

---

**5. Security 🔒**
- [ ] No sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.) in the code—everything secure!
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and safe—no outdated packages in the system.

---

**6. Issue Tracking 🗂️**
- [ ] PR is linked to the relevant issue or ticket (if applicable).
- [ ] Any blockers or dependencies are clearly noted for the team.

            <section class="journey">
                <p>At the beginning of his journey, Steven started using Behave BDD to verify the behavior of his applications. However, he soon encountered limitations and complexities in managing the entire infrastructure required to support a BDD workflow. This led him on a quest to find a better solution in the market. However, most available options were subscription-based or required additional software installations to manage tests or was just clunky.</p>
